[Project brief](https://docs.google.com/a/newschool.edu/document/d/1LOWQXv9i27Uj8eECxLeZi66yjTRcqk260O4kw_98eOc/edit?usp=sharing)

## My works
### Goal: "Rediscover"

First and foremost, in this *5n5* project I want to enhance my abilities to solve problems, but in a more creative way. As there will be an obligatory rule for me to follow and time restriction, it will be a good chance to exercise brainstorming and creative thinking. Also the room for iteration will be huge, because the your idea could be preliminary as well as your work. In this case, I set "Rediscover":bulb: as my goal in this project, not only trying to find a solution of a daily problem in an unusual way, a new function of an object we may never thought before, but also trying to push and challenge myself and see what I can achieve under this pressure.:smiling_imp:

### Rule:

Basically, I should choose 5 different things from my "*Kitchen*" everyday and use one of my "*5 Senses*" to finish my project with "*5 Different Media*".

* Why Kitchen?:pizza::fork_and_knife::corn::eggplant::beer:

1. It is an indispensable place/scenario in our daily lives;

2. There are various different kinds of objects in kitchen, most of which we are familiar with as we use them everyday;

3. It could be interesting to think about our relationship with this stuffs and what kind of functions kitchen performs.

* Why 5 Senses?:eyes::nose::ear::tongue::hand:

1. We depend on 5 senses to perceive the world around us, to learn and to connect;

2. 5 senses and their operation, classification, and theory are overlapping topics studied by a variety of fields, including design;

3. In most cases, we use our eyes and ears to sense and pay less attention to the performance of our noses and hands;

4. I am also trying to build the interconnetion between 5 senses.

* What kinds of media?:pencil2::scissors::art::clapper::guitar:

Under the pressure of time, I decided to do some visually intuitive projects in simple ways, like with the help of: Drawing, Making, Writing, Photos, Music, Video... (no Coding:satisfied:)

### Outcomes:

* DAY 1--Bananas--Smell--Handcraft

## Assignment guidelines
* For the next five days, create one project per day. Each project must be conceptualized, produced and documented in a single day. 
* The more experimental the better.
* Usage of skills learned in other classes is encouraged.
* Monday is Labor Day (no class) but post a link with documentation of your work on Github by EOD on Monday

## Presentation guidelines
* On Wednesday, 9/6
* 7 minutes presentation each person
* 30 minutes group discussion afterwards

## Questions
* What are some rules you put in place for your project?
* What is the relationship between concept and execution?
* Is there something that ties the projects together?
* How could you have improved them?
* Did you enjoy the exercise, why or why not? What were some struggles?
