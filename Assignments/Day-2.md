One interesting thing I found about these washing sponges is that they have TWO sides: one side is hard and rough, another side is soft and fine. This dual-functionality facilitates our daily lives.

I tried to extend this duality by trying to associate it with words that give the same feeling when I touch the washing sponge:

###### "Hard and Rough": "Difficult", "Dislike", "Negative", "Harmful", "Dangerous"...

###### "Soft and Fine": "Easy", "Like", "Positive", "Healthy", "Safe"...

Colors are often regarded to convey certain information that connected with our emotions and feelings. Like "Red" :rotating_light: often used to call people's attention, while "Green":four_leaf_clover: represents safe and sound. So I thought:

### Besides using colors to give a visual impact during the formation of our cognition, what if we can also touch to learn new things :question:
