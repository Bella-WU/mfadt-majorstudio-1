One interesting thing I found about these washing sponges is that they have two sides: one side is hard and rough, another side is soft and fine. This dual-functionality facilitates our daily lives. I tried to associate this duality with something else like *"Hard and Rough"* is related to "Difficult", "Dislike", "Negative", "Harmful", "Dangerous"... *"Soft and Fine"*, conversely, is related to "Easy", "Like", "Positive", "Healthy", "Safe"...

### How can I make them "speak" to remind me to enjoy my everyday banana:question:
