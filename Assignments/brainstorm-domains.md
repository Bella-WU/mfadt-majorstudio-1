## In-class assignment guidelines
* Define three areas/domains of research interest
* Come up with 3 concepts of projects you want to work on at DT. From abstract to concrete, from solution-based to purely experimental. These can be short projects (1-3 weeks) or long projects (6-8 weeks)
* Group them based on where they fall into the domains
* List project precedents from a range of different media/methodologies

## Presentation guidelines
* Wednesday, 9/6
* 7 minutes presentation each person
* 30 minutes group discussion afterwards

## Questions
* What are some rules you put in place for your project?
* What is the relationship between concept and execution?
* Is there something that ties the projects together?
* How could you have improved them?
* Did you enjoy the exercise, why or why not? What were some struggles?
