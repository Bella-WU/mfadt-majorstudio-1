## Idea

One thing that surprise me when I first went shopping in NY is that shops here are really GENEROUS! The cashier will seperate your goods in :three: bags even if they CAN be hold in just :one: bag.

Gradually, those plastic shopping bags pile up in my cupboard. And the speed I recycle them as trash bags is always slower than the speed I get new ones.

### :question:So...maybe I could also make :recycle:*"A Trash Bags Dress"*:recycle: like those boring people on the Internet:question::sweat_smile:
