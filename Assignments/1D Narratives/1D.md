## My Thematic Focus: The relationship between our senses and cognition
I pick the concept of Day2 from my *"5-in-5 Assignment"* as my focus in this "Ideas in Form" practice.

In my Day2 Project, I got an inspiration from the washing sponges in my kitchen. As I touch it, the different feelings the two sides give me let me think about other associated words, like:

###### "Hard and Rough": "Difficult", "Dislike", "Negative", "Harmful", "Dangerous"...

###### "Soft and Fine": "Easy", "Like", "Positive", "Healthy", "Safe"...

Then a question came to my mind:

#### :question:Besides using colors to give a visual impact during the formation of our cognition, what if we can also touch to learn new things :question:

In this case, I developed an interest in studying the relationship between our senses and cognition.
