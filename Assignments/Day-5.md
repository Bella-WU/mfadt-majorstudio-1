## Idea

I used to starting everyday with a fried egg and a glass of juice or soymilk.

I enjoy the process of frying an egg as well as smelling it as well as eating it.:stuck_out_tongue:

### :question:So... maybe it will also give me a pleasure when I listening to it:question:

## Solution

Here's my idea:

First, make an audio record of frying an egg;

Second, edit the audio and voice;

Then, I will have a customized :alarm_clock:*"A Morning Call"*:alarm_clock: for myself!
