# 2D & 3D
## Central Concept:bulb:

Basically, I am still working on what I had explored in my *"5-in-5 Assignment"* as well as my *"1D Narratives"*, that is

#### :question:What kinds of role our senses play during the formation of our cognition, like when we are learning a new thing, or in a new environment:question:

But, based on the feedbacks I got from the class & Fei about my *"1D Narratives"*, I decided to jump out of the circle of "children" and switch my focus to ordinary people, just like everyone.

And maybe it's because the project we are exploring is called *"Ideas in Form"*, I realized that when we are talking about "sense", it must be something tangible, like it can either be seen, be heard, or be touched, be smelled. Then, what aboue something that is intangible? Like time.
