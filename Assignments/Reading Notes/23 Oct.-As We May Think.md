## As We May Think :books:
- A visionary and influential work wrote in 1945 by *Vannevar Bush*

- What did he say in this book?
1. Show concern about the development of technology: leading to destruction of humans and mutual slaughter between different races or
peace and happiness? (atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki)
2. Question the way people extract, process, record, select and index knowledge in the future society where information is continuously
exploding
3. Conceive a sort of collective memory machine to realize almost unlimited memorizing and associative indexing of knowledge
4. Raise several examples of application of "memex" in different fields

- What I found interesting?

Actually, many of Bush's bold predictions has already come into existence, including hypertext, personal computers, the Internet, the
World Wide Web and online encyclopedias such as Wikipedia. However, at the same time modern technology in some fields still doesn't
come up to Bush's imagination. And the storage of knowledge should still be considered as a major and complicated problem today. Besides, 
private information security emerge as new problem in this new digital age.

- My thinking

The revolution of technology closely related to our daily lives has led to the fact that the modernization of information and communication
processes has become the driving force of social evolution. Being different from data, which are raw and unorganized facts, information is
a processed product of human activities. A reasonable reaction or a sensible decision we make under different circumstances requires a
mastery of information from acquisition to filtering, to classification, to systemization and so on. As we are living in a continuously
updating world full of interconnections and uncertainties, “Quantity” is no longer the problem but a new trouble. Information Overload has
become one of the key issues, maybe the curse, in this field since the advent of Digital Age, which gave birth to numbers of sharing
communities like Quora and wikiHow. Those fast tracks between questions and answers extricate us to a great extent from being saturated
and entangled with time-consuming tasks like collection and selection. At the same time, the spirit of the Internet to be liberal and
open reduces the costs of spreading knowledge in this commercialized society and therefore expedites the evolution of human civilization
based on cooperation and innovation. However, something is missing generally without being paid much attention. That is, the simplified
“Quantity” of information guarantees not always a refined high “Quality”, what we read and listen is second-hand information, already
chewed by others. A new kind of modern disease has spread with the symptom of accepting ideas from others indiscriminately and duplicating
without reflection. We avoid the complexity of information, but we also lose the chance to explore and the ability to innovate. We lose
ourselves.
