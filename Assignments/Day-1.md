As a lazy person, I love bananas, because they are easy to peel. However, at the same time, they are also easy to go rotten. And when one of them go rotten, all of them will go rotten AS FAST AS THEY CAN!! I always don't remember to eat my bananas until one day they can not be eaten any longer.:cry:

Because bananas can not speak like people.:expressionless: They can not call you to eat them. So I was wondering:

### How can I make them "speak" to remind me to enjoy my everyday banana:question:
